Feel free to download my implementation of the Vulkan tutorial. Clone my repository by calling git clone --recursive https://github.com/JohnCenaSlapsDomTorettoAcrossTheFace/Vulkan Vulkan SDK need to be downloaded separately into a folder. After that set the new path inside dependencies.lua (IncludeDir ["VulkanSDK"] = "C: /VulkanSDK/xxxxx/Include") in the premake file and run the bash script in the script folder.
